# bash-scripting-learning
A place to collect any interesting BASH scripts I wrote while learning scripting.

Some of these are scripts I wrote while following tutorials, and others are ones I created on my own.

I try to follow this file naming pattern: `CATEGORY_A_B_name.sh`
- `CATEGORY` = Most often what purpose I wrote the script for, e.g. "NC" if I followed a NetworkChuck Tutorial, "MINE" if the script was my own idea, etc.
- `A` = primary number, to differentiate different scripts in the category, e.g. 1
- `B` = secondary number, for version/variant numbering, e.g. 2
- `name` = name of the script

Examples:
- `NC_1_2_hi_dad.sh`, means NetworkChuck tutorial episode 1, script variant 2, with name "hi_dad"
- `MINE_1_3_EV_CALCULATOR.sh`, means My Idea, script number 1, script variant 3, with name "EV_CALCULATOR"
